# Eduford

## Description
Eduford is a communication portal between college students and Eduford University. It provides all the necessary information for any student who might be interested in pursuing a course there, be it online or in person. This is a Front End website that I created individually to showcase my skills as well as apply new better coding practices that I learned recently.
